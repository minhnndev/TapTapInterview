### Problem Statement:

Build a simple To-do app with the following UI as described in the Build a simple To-do app with the following UI as described in the [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/Fz8vyQUiQdomPLp8XIK2Qq/Mobile-UI-Test).

### Product Requirements:

1. As a user, I can view a list of my to-do items, add new items, delete or update existing items.

3. Optimize performance for large lists.

## 2) Test Requirements:

1. **Github Repository**: So we can view your source code.
2. **APK file for Android**: So we can test your app.
3. **Any other necessary instructions or explanations**: That can help us with the evaluation.
